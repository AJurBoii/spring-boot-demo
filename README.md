# Spring Boot Demo Repository
This repo was created for the sole purpose of learning the ropes of Spring Boot. In this repo, you will find two Spring Boot projects
### demo
Demo is my very first introduction to Spring Boot. It teaches me how to initialize a Spring Boot project and how to build then run the project with Maven.

### rest-service
rest-service introduces the basics of a RESTful web application. When ran, it returns JSON that represents a greeting. The greeting has one parameter, name.
